# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains Python implementations of six classic sorting algorithms. Each script is interactive and grounded in a real-world analogy, complete with performance tracking and user input for hands-on learning and practical application.

## 🔗 Algorithms Included

---

### 🔁 Bubble Sort – Student Scores

Sorts a list of students by their test scores using a simple comparison-based approach.

**File:** `bubble_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Adjacent comparison, tuple-based sorting  
**Input:** Student names and scores  
**Output:** Sorted list of students by score  
**Bonus:** Measures execution time using `time` module

---

### ⚡ Merge Sort – Random Integer List

Uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort a randomly generated list of integers.

**File:** `merge_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Recursion, merging  
**Input:** Number of elements (generates random integers)  
**Output:** Sorted array  
**Bonus:** Confirmation prompt before execution + performance timer

---

### ✍️ Insertion Sort – Playing Cards

Simulates how a player might sort cards in their hand, one at a time.

**File:** `insertion_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Shifting elements, in-place insertion  
**Input:** Space-separated card values (integers)  
**Output:** Sorted list of cards  
**Bonus:** Tracks sort time for performance reference

---

### 📚 Selection Sort – Books by Year

Sorts a list of books in ascending order based on their publication year.

**File:** `selection_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Selection-based swapping, tuple manipulation  
**Input:** Book titles and years  
**Output:** Books sorted by publication year  
**Bonus:** Execution time display

---

### 🚀 Quick Sort – Random Integers

A Pythonic recursive implementation that picks the middle element as pivot and sorts a randomly generated list.

**File:** `quick_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Partitioning, divide-and-conquer, recursion  
**Input:** Auto-generated random list  
**Output:** Sorted list  
**Bonus:** List comprehension for elegant structure + timing logic

---

### 🧮 Radix Sort – LSD & MSD Implementations

Demonstrates both Least Significant Digit (LSD) and Most Significant Digit (MSD) versions of Radix Sort with random input.

**File:** `radix_sort.py`  
**Concepts:** Bucket sort, digit-wise processing, recursion (MSD)  
**Input:** Number of elements (randomly generated integers)  
**Output:** Two sorted arrays using LSD and MSD  
**Bonus:** Clear contrast between iterative and recursive strategies
