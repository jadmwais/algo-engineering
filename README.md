# 🔧 Algo Engineering

A growing collection of algorithm implementations and problem-solving techniques written in Python.  
This repository is built to deepen my understanding of core computer science principles and serve as a personal learning journal and portfolio for technical growth.

## 📂 Chapters

### 📊 [Sorting Algorithms](sorting/)

A full suite of classic sorting algorithms with real-world analogies and performance tracking. Each script is interactive and designed to demonstrate both the logic and practical applications of sorting methods.

- Bubble Sort (Student Scores)
- Merge Sort (Random Integers)
- Insertion Sort (Playing Cards)
- Selection Sort (Books by Publication Year)
- Quick Sort (Pythonic Recursive Version)
- Radix Sort (LSD and MSD Variants)

### 🔗 [Graph Algorithms](graphs/)

Essential graph algorithms for shortest paths and minimum spanning trees. Includes both greedy approaches and recursive logic, with clearly documented input/output and algorithm explanations.

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (MST with Union-Find)
- Prim’s Algorithm (MST with Min-Heap)
